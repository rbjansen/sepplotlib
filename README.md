## Installation

`pip install sepplotlib` to install.

## Credits
The one-dimensional separation plot is adapted from code originally produced by [Brian Greenhill, Michael D. Ward, and Audrey Sacks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00525.x). 
The bi-separation plot and model criticism plot are adapted from code originally produced by [Michael Colaresi and Zuhaib Mahmood](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343316682065).

## Example usage
